About the Project

Our project aims to develop an eco-friendly village using scientific principles from Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science.

Biology – Sustainable Agriculture

We designed Aeroponics & Hydroponics systems to optimize plant growth without soil.
	•	Aeroponics: Plants grow in air, nourished by nutrient-rich mist.
	•	Hydroponics: Plants are cultivated in water infused with essential nutrients.
	•	Plants Used: Basil, mint, tomatoes, and other leafy greens.
	•	Challenges Faced: High setup costs, technical knowledge, and model design difficulties.

Chemistry – Water Purification System

We created a wastewater treatment plant model that purifies contaminated water using:
	•	Filtration Layers: Gravel, charcoal, sand, and fabric.
	•	Chemical Purification: Chlorine treatment.
	•	Challenges Faced: Material procurement and precision in constructing the model.

Physics – Hydraulic Jack Bridge & Renewable Energy
	•	Hydraulic Jack Bridge: Uses syringes as hydraulic jacks to lift and lower a model bridge.
	•	Renewable Energy: Hydroelectric and solar panels generate power.
	•	Energy Storage: 12V DC motors, solar panels, and battery storage.
	•	Challenges Faced: Budget constraints and sourcing necessary materials.

Computer Science – Smart Village Design

Our project integrates automation and AI for efficient village management.
	•	Website Development: Interactive showcase of our project.
	•	Simulation & 3D Design: Digital models of our eco-friendly village.
	•	Challenges Faced: Coding complexities and refining animations.

Our Journey

From research to execution, our team has worked tirelessly to develop a sustainable and innovative model. Despite challenges like funding, material limitations, and technical hurdles, we collaborated, learned, and innovated to make this project a success.
